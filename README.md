# APEX 26 — Championship Intelligence

**Live Demo:** https://apex-26-championship-intelligence.vercel.app/

A cinematic motorsport intelligence portfolio system built with **React, TypeScript, Vite, and OpenF1-derived public data**.

APEX 26 turns verified championship, event, driver, constructor, weather, and historical-session information into a connected race-operations interface. It combines a Command Centre, Driver Intelligence dossiers, Constructor Intelligence, Circuit Matrix, transparent Scenario Lab, historical replay capability, Predictive Outlook, local caching, archive recovery, and explicit data-integrity controls.

> **Portfolio project:** APEX 26 is an unofficial motorsport analytics demonstration. It is not affiliated with Formula 1, the FIA, any racing team, driver, or commercial rights holder.

## Data Integrity Principles

APEX follows strict data-discipline rules:

1. **Verified inputs only**
   Championship standings, session metadata, driver data, and completed race records are sourced from OpenF1-derived public data or a previously verified local cache.

2. **No fabricated verified data**
   Missing results, unavailable metrics, unindexed rounds, tyre state, weather observations, timing, and strategy calls are never presented as verified facts.

   Predictive Outlook outputs are clearly labelled as evidence-weighted model estimates. They are separated from verified historical records and never presented as guaranteed race outcomes.

3. **Partial archive is visible**
   Archive coverage is displayed across the system. Metrics derived from indexed race records are clearly labelled as partial when completed rounds remain pending.

4. **Replay is not presented as live timing**
   Historical session replay is explicitly labelled as replay intelligence. Live timing is shown only when a verified current timing source is available.

5. **Scenario Lab is evidence-based**
   The Title Path Index ranks current contender evidence; it is not a prediction engine or probability model.

6. **Forecast and weather signals are labelled separately**
   Weather information is treated as external forecast context when available within the provider’s supported time window. Model estimates show evidence coverage and confidence so uncertainty remains visible.

7. **Source restrictions are handled safely**
   During provider restrictions, rate limits, or unavailable access, APEX preserves available verified cache data and pauses unsupported refresh behaviour.

## Cache and Archive Strategy

### Core Snapshot

The primary championship snapshot includes:

* Current calendar and event state
* Driver standings
* Constructor standings
* Driver metadata
* Latest verified result
* Shared championship context

Core data is cached locally to allow fast re-entry and graceful fallback when public source access is temporarily unavailable.

### Analytics Archive

The analytics archive indexes completed race and qualifying data progressively.

It supports:

* Recent-form calculations
* Average finish and qualifying metrics
* Completion and reliability rates
* Teammate comparisons
* Driver contribution analysis
* Historical replay inputs
* Predictive Outlook evidence inputs
* Transparent archive coverage reporting

Partially indexed rounds remain visibly marked as pending rather than being estimated.

### Rate-Limit and Restriction Handling

The application uses controlled request behaviour to reduce avoidable source pressure:

* Serial API request processing
* Delayed historical archive requests
* Retry and cooldown handling for restricted access
* Cached-data fallback
* Visible source and archive status
* Manual recovery controls for missing rounds

## Current Scope and Limitations

* Public source access may be temporarily restricted during active sessions.
* Analytics archive coverage can be partial while historical rounds are being indexed.
* Missing historical records remain pending instead of being estimated.
* Predictive Outlook is an explainable, evidence-weighted portfolio model, not a trained machine-learning system.
* Forecast estimates remain deliberately cautious when completed-race evidence is limited or weather conditions increase uncertainty.
* External weather signals are available only when the upcoming event falls inside the weather provider’s supported forecast window.
* The application does not provide betting, financial, race-strategy, or title-win prediction advice.
